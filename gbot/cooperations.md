## I. BRITE-Constellation Spectropolarimetry Team
**PI: Coralie Neiner  (coralie.neiner@obspm.fr)**

The BRITE-Constellation spectropolarimetry team investigates the magnetic properties of BRITE targets using the instruments ESPaDOnS, HarpsPol and NARVAL.

For more information or access to the data, please contact Coralie Neiner directly!

Working Groups and their responsibles:

    O stars: G. Wade
    B stars: C. Neiner
    Be stars: M. Oksala
    A stars: L. Fossati
    FGK giants: A. Lebre
    FGK supergiants: J. Grunhut
    FGK main sequence stars: P. Petit
    M stars: J. Morin

## II. Cooperation with amateur observers worldwide
BRITE-Constellation targets are perfectly suited for complementary observations from amateur observers from the ground due to their relative brightness (V < 6 mag)

Therefore BRITE-Constellation welcomes contributions from the amateur community.

If you are interested to cooperate with BRITE scientists, choose a star from the attached list and get directly into contact with the responsible colleague from the BRITE team.
