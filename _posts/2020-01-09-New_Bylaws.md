The BRITE Executive Science Team has changed the data access policy: all data starting from field 48 will be made available to the public immediately without any proprietary period through the BRITE Public Data Archive.

Accordingly, a new version of the BRITE Bylaws is available [here (as of Nov 25, 2019).]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/BRITE_Bylaws-25_November_2019.pdf)
