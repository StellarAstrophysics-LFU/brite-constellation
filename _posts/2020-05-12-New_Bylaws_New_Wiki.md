title: 'New BRITE Constellation wiki & Updated Bylaws Document (12 May 2020)'
---

Due to technical issues, the old photometry wiki is not up-to-date any longer. We have moved all relevant information to the new site of the BRITE Constellation Wiki:
http://brite-wiki.astro.uni.wroc.pl/bwiki/doku.php?id=start

Please use this as a reference for targets included in BRITE fields and for the information about publications with BRITE data.


Additionally, a new version of the BRITE Bylaws document is available [here (as of May 12, 2020).]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/BRITE_Bylaws_12_May-2020_v21.pdf)
