Dear Colleagues,

From 07.11. to 17.11.2016, I will observe at the 60cm telescope
in Tatranska Lomnica (Slovakia). The telescope is equipped with an
Echelle spectrograph which gives spectra between 4400A and 7600A
with a resolution of about 12 000. A complete documentation of that
instrument and telescope can be found in this article:

If you have targets, please contact me directly:

With best regards,
Ernst
