We are currently planning an international conference in Vienna, one
year after the IAU General Assembly, from **August 19 to 23**, 2019,
with the title:

# Stars and their variability, observed from space: Celebrating the 5th anniversary of BRITE-Constellation

**More information can be found on the conference website: [https://starsandspace.univie.ac.at](https://starsandspace.univie.ac.at)**

**Stars** are the most visible components of the Universe. Most of what we
know of the universe comes from studying stars. To understand them is
important for many problem areas in astrophysics, ranging from our local
solar system with planets to the most distant galaxies. Investigating
the variability of Stars provides powerful access to their structure,
environment and evolution. Stars are crucial elements for understanding
the history and evolution of our Universe, of all galaxies, of our local
solar system and Stars host zillions of planets, which we expect to
discover in the near future – and how many are habitable?

**Stars** represent laboratory sites for physical processes that cannot be
tested experimentally on Earth. They are crucial for understanding basic
physics, such as nuclear physics, particle physics, statistical physics,
hydrodynamics, atomic physics and opacities, and more. We are facing the
limitations in theoretician’s modelling of the basic radiation, plasma
and other physics, which oversimplify (or ignore) the treatment of
radiation–matter coupling, magnetic fields, dynamical processes, etc.
Experience tells that once the physics is properly accounted for, our
picture of how stars work frequently has to be substantially changed.

**Observing Stars** from satellites has significantly increased the data
volume and parameter space for a realistic modelling of these most
prominent objects in the Universe. Variability can now be traced down
to incredibly low noise levels, thanks also to the availability of
satellites. New observing capabilities have improved precision and
accuracy, which in turn have uncovered new populations of stars and
revealed limits in our physical understanding of their structure and
evolution. In particular, BRITE-Constellation has demonstrated the unique
advantage of small satellites for exploring stars which are bright
(and close) enough to allow access to other fundamental techniques,
like interferometry, high accurate parallaxes, direct imaging, very
high spectral and temporal resolution, etc. These advantages led in 2009
to a funding of the first BRITE satellites.

**Goal:**<br/>
Convene top scientists of relevant fields in astrophysics, discuss most
recent achievements in space observations and theory, attract the young
generation, and develop a strategy for the future. Demonstrate the
innovative role of BRITE-Constellation for the development of a
significant research potential for nanosatellites.

It is true that similar conferences have been organised also in recent
years, but experience tells that progress in this field is so dramatic
that timing of our planned conference will be appropriate.
