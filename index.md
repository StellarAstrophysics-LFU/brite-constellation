# Welcome to the BRITE-Constellation website

BRITE (BRIght Target Explorer) Constellation is a network of five
nanosatellites to investigate stellar structure and evolution of the
brightest stars in the sky and their interaction with the local
environment. Micropulsation, wind phenomena, and other forms of
stellar variability are recorded via high precision photometry in
two colours (red and blue). The massive BRITE target stars are extremely
important in producing the chemical elements in our universe and
recycling them in winds and supernovae. They are “laboratories” that
help us to understand a wide range of astrophysical processes in our universe.

The BRITE nanosatellites operate in low-earth-orbits which allow for a
superior time coverage and data length, not obtainable from ground.
Both are crucial for a detailed asteroseismic study, which also
benefits from two-colour information.
