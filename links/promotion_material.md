## I. Build your own paper model of a BRITE nano-satellite
The original idea and design are by Manuela Unterberger (IKS, TU Graz). There are several versions which are explained below.

### Mobile “Build your satellite”

Easy version: Print out this model on an A1 paper. You will get a mobile with nearly original size. Printed on A3 paper it will be a 1:2 model; and on an A4 paper it will be a 1:3 model. Cut it out, stick the planes together to get a 3D model that you can use as decoration!

### Original Mock-up

Advanced version: Print out this model on three A3 pages, cut them out and stick them together on the appropriate edges. You will get a 1:1 model of the BRITE-Austria / TUG-Sat 1 or the UniBRITE satellite.
