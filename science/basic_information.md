**BRITE Constellation** measures low-level oscillations and temperature
variations in stars brighter than visual apparent magnitude of about 6.0.
([A detailed description is given in Weiss et al. 2014; download here.](https://www.univie.ac.at/brite-constellation/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/PASP.pdf))

These stars turn out, for the most part, to be among the most luminous â€“
either massive stars during any of their evolutionary phases or
medium-mass stars at the very end of their nuclear-burning stages.

Such massive stars dominate the ecology of the Universe: During their
relatively brief lives and in their spectacular deaths as supernovae,
massive stars inject enriched gas into the interstellar medium adding
heavy elements critical to the formation of future stars, terrestrial
planets and organics.

**Although the role of luminous stars in the Universe is so crucial and
although they are the brightest stars in the night sky, they are still
inadequately understood.**

They are distributed all over the sky (see Figure):
