---

The BRITE Executive Science Team has adopted the European Astronomical Societyâ€™s Ethics Statement and Guidelines for Good Practice ([EAS Ethics Statement](https://eas.unige.ch/documents/EAS_Ethics_Statement.pdf)). Members of BEST and BIAST agree to adhere to the principles laid out in that document. Some key elements of this document include the following:

- All scientists should act ethically in their capacity as researchers, teachers, educators and mentors and should be aware of their responsibility of training students and young scientists in ethical conduct.

- All professional interactions should be conducted with consideration and respect. Abusive, intimidating, humiliating or demeaning behaviour is not acceptable under any circumstances.

- Equal opportunity and treatment should be afforded to all colleagues, regardless of sex, gender, race, ethnic and national origin, socio-economic background, political affiliation, religion, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability and any intersection thereof, and any other reason not related to scientific merit. The workplace should be a harassment-free environment.

- Research should be conducted with honesty and integrity. Data should be analysed, made available and published in a timely manner.

- Access to data, public or private, should be clearly acknowledged.

- Authorship of publications is the primary means of assigning credit for work done. Therefore, the author list should include all, and only, individuals who have contributed significantly to the research or work reported in such publications.

- Conflicts of interest are to be identified, disclosed, and managed.

Inquiries can be addressed to the current BEST Chair, BEST Vice-Chair or any member of BEST.
